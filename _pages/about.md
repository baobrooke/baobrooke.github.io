Welcome to the Laboratory for Ethical and Equitable Digital Technology at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/). 

We are an interdisciplinary lab, working at the intersection of computer science and ethics, that considers how to design and promote the creation of ethical technology at Wellesley College and beyond.
